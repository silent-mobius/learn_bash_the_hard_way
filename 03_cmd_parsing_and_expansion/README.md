# Command Line Expansions and Data Parsing

Bash shell as a programming language has great built-in parsing of command-line arguments and the various expansions it performs on words in the line.

Then bash examines the resulting words, performing up to eight types of expansion on them as appropriate:

- Brace expansion
- Tilde expansion
- Parameter and variable expansion
- Arithmetic expansion
- Command substitution
- Word splitting
- Pathname expansion
- Process substitution
